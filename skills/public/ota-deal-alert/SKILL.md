# OTA Deal-Alert Skill (Skills-First)

## Core purpose
Create an installable agent skill that:
- Tracks flight/hotel price drops and sends alerts
- Generates 3–5 day itineraries
- Routes users through affiliate links with compliant disclosure
- Is packaged for agents to install and drive conversions

## When to use
- Building or updating a travel deal alert skill
- Drafting alert outputs, itineraries, or landing copy for skill listings
- Designing affiliate conversion flows or disclosure language

## Required outputs (minimum)
- Deal alert template (email/DM)
- 3–5 day itinerary template
- Affiliate disclosure snippet
- Skill listing copy (short)

- **Cold-start content plan (CN)**: see `references/content-cn.md`
- **Acceptance criteria (TDD)**: see `references/acceptance.md`

## Guardrails
- Do NOT claim to book tickets; always direct to OTA/affiliate links.
- Include disclosure in alerts and landing pages.
- Avoid scraping sites unless explicitly allowed by provider terms.
